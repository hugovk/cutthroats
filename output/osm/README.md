## How to find potential cutthroats in English street names

1. We'll use some Python scripts to search for cutthroats, so let's fetch that and do everything from the same directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugovk/cutthroats
cd cutthroats
```

2. Download [england-latest.osm.pbf](http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain/england-latest.osm.pbf) (718 MB) from http://download.geofabrik.de/europe/great-britain.html

3. We'll use [osmfilter](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter) to filter for street names. To allow fast data processing, they recommend using .o5m format for input, so we'll use [osmconvert](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert) for that, and also to convert it to a text file. Download or install osmconvert (eg. download a binary) and osmfilter (eg. `brew install osmfilter`).

4. Convert the pbf to o5m:
```bash
osmconvert england-latest.osm.pbf -o=england-latest.o5m
```
<sub>(28s, 718M -> 1.3G)</sub>

5. Filter and keep all the highways ([eg.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter#Object_Filter))
```bash
osmfilter england-latest.o5m --keep="highway=" -o=england-highways.o5m
```
<sub>(18s, 1.3G -> 412M)</sub>

6. Write that out to a text file using CSV format ([eg.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert#Writing_CSV_Files)), and remove duplicates
```bash
osmconvert england-highways.o5m --csv=name -o=england-highways.csv
```
<sub>(3s, 412M->21M, 1 478 885 lines)</sub>

7. Sort and remove duplicates
```bash
sort -u england-highways.csv > 2.csv && mv 2.csv england-highways.csv
```
<sub>(28s, 21M->6.2M, 390 368 lines)</sub>

8. Look for cutthroats

Given some known cutthroats, find their verb- stems. Then given the CSV of names, find other words beginning with those verbs.
They might be new cutthroats!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cutthroat-finder.py -f england-highways.csv > england-highways-cutthroats.txt
```
<sub>(25s, 6.2M -> 89K, 9 724 lines, 9 555 potential new cutthroats)</sub>

The repeat but only return potential cutthroats that also end in known -nounstems.
Fewer results, but better chance of cutthroats?

```bash
python cutthroat-finder.py -f england-highways.csv --match-nouns > england-highways-cutthroats2.txt
```
<sub>(25s, 6.2M -> 4.3K, 468 lines, 329 potential new cutthroats)</sub>

## How to find potential cutthroats in English place names

Let's repeat but on all place names in England, not just the highways.
Basically steps 1-4 as above, skip the filtering in step 5, and steps 6-10 from england-latest.o5m.

6. Write that out to a text file using CSV format ([eg.](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert#Writing_CSV_Files)), and remove duplicates
```bash
osmconvert england-latest.o5m --csv=name -o=england.csv
```
<sub>(10s, 1.3G->34M, 2 313 803 lines)</sub>

7. Sort and remove duplicates
```bash
sort -u england.csv > 2.csv && mv 2.csv england.csv
```
<sub>(48s, 34M->15M, 845 787 lines)</sub>

```bash
python cutthroat-finder.py -f england.csv --match-nouns > england-cutthroats2.txt
